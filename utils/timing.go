// Package timing contains utility functions
// to measure execution times. It identifies measure
// by names to be able to start and stop the measurements
// from completely different parts of the code without
// having to share a variable.
//
// This package can be configured to use any
// object that implements the Output interface
// from the output package to write it's results.

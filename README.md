# PriFi doc

In this branch I try to update the project's documentation. Below is
a list of functions/types that I do not know how to document:

```
prifi_lib/crypto/schnorr.go:
	SchnorrVerify

prifi_lib/dcnet/test.go:
	all

prifi_lib/scheduler.deprecated/scheduler.go (not sure if needed):
	all
```

1. Introduction
   
   PriFi is an anonymous communication protocol with provable traffic-analysis resistance and small latency suitable 
   for wireless networks. This provides a network access mechanism for protecting members of an organization who 
   access the Internet while on-site (via privacy-preserving WiFi networking) and while off-site (via 
   privacy-preserving virtual private networking or VPN). The small latency cost is acheved by leveraging the 
   client-relay-server topology common in WiFi networks.
   
   Main entities :
      * Relay
      * TrusteeServer (spawns Trustees)
      * Clients

   These collaborate to implement a Dining Cryptographer's network that can anonymize the client upstream traffic.
   
2. Coding style
   
   Gofmt:
      We use Gofmt which is the official formating style for Go. Gofmt automatically formats Go source code, and 
      thus there's no need to spend time lining up the code or think how many spaces are needed between math operators.
      This formatting style is recommended by Effective Go: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting
       
      More details on how to use Gofmt: https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code
       
   Line width:
       The preferred number of characters per line is 120. This makes coding in laptops easier. One or two characters
       beyond 120 is fine. Queries and regular expressions may go beyond this for obvious reasons. Gofmt uses tabs 
       for indentation so feel free to change your editor's tab length if 120 characters is still large for your screen.
